Fix <b>uTorrent</b> toolbar size using AutoIt script

For past few years in uTorrent toolbar some buttons are not visible due left are being too small and ad/search bar covering part of it.
This script waits in background for uTorrent window to be focused and sets toolbar width to 299px..

- add in .lnk in Startup to auto-launch with windows..
